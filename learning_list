List of phases from paper to be good at explaining (and questions from comments)
    The standard model is verified to astonishing accuracy
    All SM particles transform according to the gauged symmetry group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)
    The fermions are categorized by which representation of each group they fit into
    know about the weinberg angle, first measured precisely in neutrino electron elastic scattering
    why can't you explicitly break gauge symmetry?
    Because the Higgs is a fundamental scalar, its corrections depend quadratically on the cutoff scale
    The cutoff scale is the largest energy scale for which the SM is valid
    The fermions and gauge bosons only depend logarithmically on the cutoff scale
    be prepared to offer historical examples of times when fine tuning was a hint of some deeper theory and times when it was not
    Supersymmetry (SUSY) introduces a new symmetry in which every SM field fits into a larger multiplet with an inherent symmetry between bosons and fermions
    Why does susy need a 2nd Higgs doublet?
    R-parity prevents proton decay
    Know about the beam, says stan
    simply explain how the LHC works during your talk: how does it accelerate protons, how does it curve their trajectories in a circle, etc, says andrew
    Learn context for #s in 'Lead tungstate crystals allow for a fast (\SI{80}{\percent} of light within \SI{25}{\nano\s}), compact (radiation length = \SI{0.89}{cm}), fine-grained (Moli\`ere radius = \SI{2.2}{cm}), and radiation hard (up to 10 Mrad) calorimeter'
    Why do electrons and photons shower in the ECAL but not (usually) hadrons?, asks andrew
    Get a feel for 0.087x0.087 in eta-phi
    The choice of detector varies between barrel and endcap due to the difference in neutron-induced background, muon rates, and magnetic field strength
    Is entire detector read out at L1 trigger?
    displaced and disappearing cover a wide range of lifetimes and topologies for LLPs that decay on detector timescales
    ATLAS performs a search for such particles by looking for at least one DV along with large MET and large track multiplicity
    Why pions in disappearing decays?
    Why might ew gaugino production be only gaugino production mode at lhc if gluino mass is kinematically inaccessible?
    disappearing backgrounds come primarily from $\ttbar$ and $\W/\Z + \mathrm{jets}$ processes
    why does 0 CSC hits minimize beam halo?
    Why do first two models in hscp relate more directly to naturalness and SUSY?
    Why is leaving out mchamps cool?
    What is mu parameter in SUSY? How is it related to higgsino mass?
    Is it only the lightest higgsino that corrects mH at tree-level?
    Messenger scale vs susy breaking scale vs cutoff scale
    What are the consequences of a lower messenger scale?
    Is M_3 in eq. 4 just m_gluino?
    What's up with m_stop vs m_t1-type stuff?
    The Higgsino, however, does not carry color charge and is far less likely to be produced at the LHC
    a small region of $\Delta < 10$ parameter space is currently viable in all cases but, barring discovery, will be excluded within the next few years.
