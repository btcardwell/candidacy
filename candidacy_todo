    Review
        Concepts
            SM basics
            CMS detector subsystems
                Chris asks about tracker e.g. depletion zone in p-n junction
            ParticleFlow basics
            Chris loves asking about naturalness and hierarchy more than anything
                Understand problem
                Understand Higgs mechanism and how it relates
                Understand how BSM fixes problem 
                    Basic SUSY in this context
            Statistics
                Specifically, how are limits calculated?
        Skills
           Writing matrix elements from diagrams - only kinda important says andrew
           Identify process from CMS reconstructed final states - only kinda important says andrew
        Memorize
            SM masses, widths, etc
            Hadron masses, widths, etc
            CMS/LHC factoids
            value of hbar*c, etc
    Read
        PDG (188)
            passage of particles through matter (40)
            particle detectors at accelerators (88)
            probability (11)

Presentation
    Things to practice saying aloud to knowledegable people
        How is a limit plot made?
        What's the hierarchy problem?
        What's naturalness?
        How does the Higgs mechanism work?
        Why is the Higgs mass a bigger deal for naturalness than other SM particles?
        How does (insert CMS subdetector) work?
        How does SUSY solve SM naturalness problem?
        Can you give me a quick tour of the SM?
        What are the SM LLPs in CMS?
        How could one identify an LLP in CMS?
        Where are the best places to look for LLPs in 2017?
        What happens if we don't find hints of natural BSM in Run II?
        How to interpret limit summary plots (e.g. sparticle masses) in context of LLPs?

Bureaucracy
    Set date (see if Linda can do 8/14)
    Set room
    Fill out grad school form before 7/17
    Make sure projecter exists and works with laptop
