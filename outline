Naturalness and Long-Lived BSM Particles

Chris suggests the following topics:
    (1) The role of the Naturalness in BSM extensions of the Standard Model
    (2) The various ways long-lived particles arise in both the SM and BSM extensions
    (3) Overview of the CMS detector
    (4) Review of the current state of the LHC searches for long-lived BSM particles
    (5) Discussion of compatibility of experimental results and viability of Natural BSM
    (6) Your informed opinion on what are the most important searches to be done in 2017
