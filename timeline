Learning list
.    4 Analyses in depth
    A few more analyses shallow
.    Finish SM paper
    More naturalness, hierarchy, fine-tuning
.    CMS subdetectors
    CMS TDR
    Higgs mechanism thoroughly
    Beyond tree-level SM
    How is SUSY natural?
    SUSY basics (probably from SUSY Primer)
    Basics of SUSY beyond MSSM that lead to LLP (split, stealth, etc)
    MC methods
    LL SM particles
    SM production, decay, and reconstruction in CMS
        gamma
        e
        mu
        tau
        q
        g
        b
        t
        hadrons
        W
        Z
        H
    Particle interaction w/ matter
    Particle detectors at accelerators
    Make sure I'm extremely clear on definition, typical values, etc of
        Luminosity
        Cross section
        Width
        Branching fraction
        <dE/dx>
