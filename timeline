Learning list
.    4 Analyses in depth
    A few more analyses shallow
.    Finish SM paper
    More naturalness, hierarchy, fine-tuning
.    CMS subdetectors
    Higgs mechanism thoroughly
    How is SUSY natural?
    SUSY basics (probably from SUSY Primer)
    Basics of SUSY beyond MSSM that lead to LLP (split, stealth, etc)
    MC methods
    LL SM particles
    SM production, decay, and reconstruction in CMS
    Particle interaction w/ matter
    Particle detectors at accelerators
