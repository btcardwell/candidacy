        7/27 - Address comments and edit
        7/26 - Ask for feedback
        7/26 - Draft 'How do LLP searches augment these constraints and where are the gaps?'

Ideal learning schedule
    7/28 - Know everything about everything
    7/29 - Put together brain structure of CMS
    7/26 - Fate of Long-Lived Superparticles

Big picture notes
    Need to limit time spent on theory stuff to make sure I have time to learn experimental stuff
    Also limit writing time (paper shouldn't be too good or too long)
    Chris's specific examples
        EM shower
        How calorimeter works
        How tracker works
    I should go through PDG carefully and make list of questions
        Particles through Matter
        Detectors at Accelerators
        MC Methods
        Probability
        Statistics
        Kinematics
    I should go through analyses carefully and make list of questions
