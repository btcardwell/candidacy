Ideal learning schedule

Big picture notes
    Need to limit time spent on theory stuff to make sure I have time to learn experimental stuff
    Chris's specific examples
        EM shower
        How calorimeter works
        How tracker works
    I should go through PDG carefully and make list of questions
        Particles through Matter
        Detectors at Accelerators
        Probability
        Statistics
        Kinematics
    I should go through analyses carefully and make list of questions
