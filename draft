Naturalness
    - Totally spitballed after talking to Humberto on 7/10

    The naturalness criterion takes several forms, some of which feel way more like bullshit than others. Here are the formulations I can think of off the top of my head: (1) all parameters in a model should be O(1), (2) Loop-level contributions should not be larger than tree-level contributions, (3) any small parameter should be protected by a custodial symmetry, and (4) fine-tuning is bad. To my ear, (1) and (2) sound dumb, and (3) and (4) might be compelling with the right context.
    Let's look at (3). In the SM, the parameter of interest is the Higgs mass, which unlike the fermions and gauge bosons, has no custodial symmetry to hold it down. The fermions masses are protected by a U(1)xU(1) chiral symmetry that would exist if the fermions were massless, and the vector bosons are protected by gauge symmetry (*how does this one work? Would gauge symmetry be enlarged if vector bosons were massless?). The Higgs, a fundamental scalar has no such symmetry. Looking at the 1-loop corrections to the Higgs propagator, we see a quadratic dependence on the cutoff scale.
    Now look at (4), again in the context of the Higgs mass. If mH depends quadratically on the cutoff, we expect it's mass to be fucking huge, like comparable to the cutoff scale. We know experimentally that its mass is 125.1 GeV, so it's bare mass (*or is it a coupling constant of some kind? I need to be extremely clear on this) must exactly cancel the cutoff-dependent contribution. Whatever, you might say. Things cancel each other out sometimes. In this case, however, the values need to be tuned to the tune of 1 part in 10^30 or some crazy shit like that(I made up that number, but you get the idea). We have no good explanation for why these two numbers would match so perfectly, so it seems incredibly suspicious that it would just happen by chance.
    There are other unnatural quantities that people worry about (even though they're less important to my world). I know of two off the top of my head: (1) whatever the parameter of interest is in the strong CP problem and (2) the cosmological consant. The strong CP problem is something like "some parameter in QCD stuff implies maximal CP violation, but we don't see any CP violation in strong interactions. The cosmological constant is way the fuck too small compared to naive expectations. Maybe like 120 orders of magnitude too small? I don't know of any reasonable solutions to the cosmological constant problem, and it seems like such a giant crazy problem that people just kinda sweep it under the rug. I have now said roughly everything I know about naturalness problems outside the contet of the Higgs mass.
    There are a few proposed solutions to the SM naturalness problem. SUSY is the main one, and I'll spend the great majority of my time on it. Extra dimensions and composite Higgs models are the other two that pop up fairly often, but won't spend much time on them outside the next two sentences. Extra dimensions solves the hierarchy problem either by lowering the cutoff scale (as in large extra dimensions (ADD)) or introducing a warping factor that reduces the level of unnaturalness (warped extra dimensions (RS)). Composite Higgs models propose that the Higgs stops behaving as a fundamental scalar at some energy level, which removes the quadratic dependence.
    SUSY introduces a new symmetry in which every field can rotate freely between fermions and bosons. Thus, everycorrection to the Higgs mass from a fermion loop is exactly cancelled by the assoicated boson loop, and vice-versa. We know that SUSY can't be an exact symmetry because the superpartners would have already been observed with the same mass as their SM counterparts. Broken SUSY can still be natural, however, as long as it's approximately true. That is, as long as the superpartners show up at a mass scale not too far above the EW scale. Some sparticles are more important than others for correcting the higgs mass and therefore naturalness, so we can get away with some sparticles being more massive than others, which is getting more appealing as null LHC results keep rolling in. There are other tricky things you can do to work around all these null results; I'll need to learn more about them in the immediate future.

        The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is composed of 61200 lead tunstate crystals in the barrel and 7324 in each endcap (*is 'each' right?). Lead tungstate crystals allow for a fast (80% of light within 25 ns), compact (radiation length = 0.89 cm), fine-grained (Moliere length = 2.2 cm), and radiation hard (up to 10 Mrad) calorimeter. The main drawback is the relatively low light yield (30 photon / MeV), which necesitates photodetectors with intrinsic gain that work in magnetic fields (*say B-field part better). 

        The barrel section (EB) extends from 129 to ### (*look up) cm and covers a pseudorapidity range of 0 to 1.479. Each crystal covers about 1 (*square?) degree in theta-eta (*double check) and is tapered (*right word?) so that it's long edges define lines of constant phi. In the end, the crystals have a width of approximately one Moliere radius and a depth of 25.8 radiation lengths.

        The endcap section (EE) is 314 cm from the IP (*right word?) and covers a pseudorapidity range of 1.479 to 3.0. Additionally, a preshower detector (two planes of silicon strip detectors and a lead absorber) sits just inside the grid of lead tungstate crystals. (*Say what the preshower is for? Is it for pi0 rejection? If so, how and why?)
    HCAL
        - cite CMS TDR

        The hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) is composed of plastic scintillator interspersed within brass absorber. The scintillation light is transferred to readout through wavelength shifting fibres (WLS) that are spliced onto clear fibers (*say what readout means. PMT?). The scintillator plates are 3.7 mm thick.
        The barrel section (HB) spans a pseudorapidty range of -1.4 to 1.4 and has 2304 towers, each of which ha 15 brass plates and covers an area of 0.087 x 0.087 in eta-phi. In addition, a single layer of 10 mm thick scintillator tiles sits just outside the solenoid. This extra layer, known as hadron outer (HO), spans a pseudorapidty range of -1.26 to 1.26 and increaes the effective HCAL interaction length to greater than 10.
        Each endcap consists of 14 towers with five degree phi segmentation and spans a pseudorapidity range of 1.3 to 3.0. Also, a steel and quartz fiber forward calorimeter (HF) sits 11.2 m from the interaction pipe in a pseudorapidty range of 3.0 to 5.0. In HF, particles produce Cherenkov light when traversing the quartz fibers that run parallel to the beamline. (*say why HF is necessary)
    Solenoid
        - cite CMS TDR

        CMS employs a 4T superconducting solenoid to aid in the measurement of charged particle momenta. The solenoid consists of 2168 turns of Nb-Ti superconducting cable and has an inner diameter of 5.9 m and a length of 12.9 m (*is 5.9 right? I see "cold bore = 6.3 m" in "At the CERN LHC"). The flux returns through an iron yoke that also houses the muon system. The significant (*quantify?) bending power helps CMS meet its physics goals of unambiguous sign determination and momentum resolution of 10% for muons up to 1 TeV.
    Muon system
        - cite CMS TDR
        - Specifically mention CMS design specs to meet physics goals?
        - Probably a sentence about the technology choices in each of DT, CSC, and RPCs would be good
        - Describe orientation of DTs?

        The muon system (MS), which is the outermost subdetector, detects muons with 3 varieties of gaseous ionization detectors: drift tubes (DTs) in the barrel, cathode strip chambers (CSCs) in the endcaps, and resistive plate chambers (RPCs) in both the barrel and endcaps. The DTs and CSCs were chosen for the barrel and endcap, respectively, because the neutron-induced background, muon rates, and strength of the magnetic field are all higher in the encap. The RPCs are useful in both the endcaps and barrel because their fast response and good time resolution allow unambiguous bunch crossing identification. Combining MS and tracker measurements improves the muon pT resolution at high momenta where the tracker pT resolution declines (*quantify).

        In the barrel detector (BD), four layers of DTs and and RPCs are embedded in the solenoid return yoke at 4.0, 4.9, 5.9, and 7.9 m. SAY SOMETHING ABOUT HOW DTS ACTUALLY WORK. The maximum drift length is 2 cm and the single point resolution is 200 um. When reconstructing a vector describing the muon momentum, the phi precision is better than 100 um in position and 1 mrad in direction. 

        Each muon endcap detector (ME) is composed of 234 CSCs and 4 RPC stations (*figure out exactly what RPC station means and say that instead). Each CSC has six gas gaps with radial cathode strips and nearly perpendicualr planes of anode wires. The wire signal from the ionization-induced electron avalanch is fast enough to use in the L1 trigger, but the slower (*quantify) cathode strip signal provides precise (*quantify) position measurements. In the end, the CSC spacial resolution is approximate 200 um and the angular resolution is approximately 10 mrad.
    Trigger, particle reconstruction, etc

        - Is entire detector read out at L1?
        - Mention fpgas in L1 or more details about HLT?

        The trigger reduces the data writing rate from the 40 MHz collision rate to less than 1 kHz so that events can be written to tape. The rate reduction happens in two stages: Level-1 (L1) and High-Level Trigger (HLT). The HLT uses input from ECAL, HCAL, and MS that represents physics objects (e/gamma, tau, jets, ET, and mu) and uses custom electronics to reduce the rate to ~100 kHz in 3.8 us. The HLT then uses a dedicated processor farm to reduce the rate to the desired < 1 kHz.
